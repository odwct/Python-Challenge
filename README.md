1. Analysis of a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

The Python Script analyzes the records to calculate and print the following values:

- The total number of months included in the dataset
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
